This repository contains all the material supporting the tutorial *Retrieval and Recommendation Systems at the Crossroads of Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Regulation*, which will be delivered at SIGIR 2022.

## Abstract

This tutorial aims at providing its audience an interdisciplinary overview about the topics of fairness and non-discrimination, diversity, and transparency of AI systems, tailored to the research fields of information retrieval and recommender systems.
By means of this tutorial, we would like to equip the mostly technical audience of SIGIR with the necessary understanding of the ethical implications of their research and development on the one hand, and of recent legal regulations that address the aforementioned challenges on the other hand.
